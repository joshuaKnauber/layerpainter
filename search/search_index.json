It takes inspiration from 2D software and programs like substance painter to provide you with a layer system and all the benefits that come with it. However the point of layer painter is not to replace blenders node system or other texturing software completely, but simply aid you in getting quick results for your materials. It also allows you to keep the texturing part of your workflow in blender and avoid constant importing and exporting. If you at any point experience issues or want to talk about the addon, join the Discord server ! Where to get it You can currently get Layer Painter on Blendermarket , Gumroad or the Flipped Normals marketplace . About this documentation This documentation will guide you through the entire addon. You should be able to follow the navigation on the right from the top down to learn the addon as you go. Don't read the entire thing at once but work with the addon while you do and try to understand how it works that way. The best option should be to read this until you understand the basic concepts. From there on you can right click on any Layer Painter option to open the documentation for it. This way you can learn more about the addon as you go. More tutorials Here are a few tutorials. Most of them are not for the current version so a lot might have changed since then.

Optionally you can also open up the provided workspace by clicking the screen icon next to 'Layer Painter'. This workspace is set up to work well with Layer Painter but you do not need to use it. You have the same selection of materials that you get when you have 'Default' selected. The difference is in the panels below that. Note that you can switch back and forth between the two at any time. When you have the material selected that you want to edit, you have two options to progress: Channels Different to 2D software a channel in Layer Painter is not just R,G or B, but for example the Color, Roughness or Metallic of your material. You can paint on these channels, add maks and filters to them and finally bake them. Option 1: Choosing a preset Below your list of materials you will see a dropdown with a list of presets. Selecting a preset will do the following: Remove all nodes in your material Set up the nodes for that specific presets Add the channels which you'll then be able to work with The most important thing to note here is that it will remove the nodes in your material. If you already have a material set up you should go with Option 2. This option is good for when you want to add your entire material using Layer Painter or if you want a quick setup process. Option 2: Adding your own channels Alternatively to selecting a preset you can also add your own channels. For that you need to go to the shader editor where you can see the nodes of your material. You are marking an input of a node as a channel. This means that you can then add a layer where you enable this channel and get options to paint textures, add masks and more. The basic idea behind this is that Layer Painter can now add its own nodes to this input to create the layers. Select the node that has the input you want to use as a channel. In the example that is the Principled BSDF. Now you will see the inputs of that node in the panel on the right. Click on 'Add Your Input '. This will open a popup with a few settings: Name: This is the name of the channel as it will be displayed in the Layer Painter interface Add Always: If this is enabled this channel will be enabled automatically when you add a layer Use Slider: This will use a value slider instead of a color input to control this channel Default Color: This is the default color of this channel. If you have use slider enabled this is a value Use Non-Color: If this is enabled the textures you open in this channel will be opened with Non-Color selected by default Use 32 bit: If this is enabled the textures you paint in this channel will use 32 bits Use Normal Mixing: If this is enabled you will be able to use proper blending for normal maps. This should only be enabled for a Normal channel Once you click ok, the channel is added to your material and your are ready to go! Note that you can click the 'Edit Presets' button here to create a new preset from your created nodes and channels. Layer Basics Now that you have channels in your material, you can start actually using Layer Painter. Go back to the material properties panel. You will stay here from now on. Let's start by adding a layer. In the 'Layer Stack' panel you will see that a layer has appeared. Here you can give it a name or hide it. Once you add a layer the settings panel shows options for that layer. The first thing you see in the settings panel is the navigation. Here you can select what aspect of the layer you want to edit. When you have the general layer settings selected, you can see that there is a list of the enabled channels. Note that these are not all channels that you have added earlier but only those that are enabled for that particular layer. This is a pretty important concept to understand: Not every layer needs to have every channel that is available. There can be layers that only have one channel, in fact that is very common. You can, at any time, add and remove channels from a layer. Here you can choose from all the channels your material has. Below that selection you have the mapping settings. Those control the mapping of the textures that this layer has. This does not include masks which we will get into later. Try adding a few channels to your layer and playing with the values you see in the settings. Also add more layers and see how that affects what you see in the viewport. Again, this is a very important concept to understand and you will not get very far without it.","title":"Basic Workflow"},{"location":"basics/basic_workflow/#first-steps","text":"The first thing you need to do when using the addon is go to the material properties of an object and switch to Layer Painter.

Next to it is the texture popover . Below that row you can see the layer operators and then the actual stack of layers. Layer Operators The buttons on the left side of the layer operators are used to add different types of layers. The right side is then used to manipulate the added layers Add Normal Layer The first button in the row is used for adding a normal layer. These are the most common type of layers which you can paint on and add textures to. Add Filter Layer The second button is for adding filter layers. They are layers that can apply filters like changing the hue to all layers below. If you want to add a filter to just one layer you do that in the layers settings. Add Folder Layer The next button adds a folder layer. You can move other layer types in folders to add masks to all of them, or just organize your layers better. Add Sub-Material This button opens a popup for selecting a Sub-Material. Sub-Materials are basically folders that contain other layers. The folder can then show settings from the layer for quick tweaking of settings. This is good for adding materials quickly. Duplicate Layer This button duplicates the selected layer. Move Layer These buttons move the selected layer up or down in the layer stack. If the layer is above an open folder it will get moved in to the folder. Delete Layer This button will remove the selected folder. Layers Below the layer operators you can see the stack of layers. The layers are all structured in a similar way but have differences. Normal Layer The first button on the layer is for selecting it. When you have a layer selected you can change the settings for that layer. Next to it you have the eye icon for hiding the layer. Following you have the name of the layer and a color which helps you to better see the layer in the stack. Below the main layer you can see a list of the masks, filters and vector fx that have been added to the layer. When you click the first icon on one of these, it will show open up the settings for it. The eye icon hides it and the x removes it. When you use the channel dropdown mentioned above, you can see that the layer changes. The layer channel shows settings that effect all channels in a layer. When you select a different channel, you'll see settings for that channel. This also applies to the layer stack. You can see that there is now a dropdown which says 'Mix'. This is the blending mode of the channel which you can change here. Next to it is the opacity of the layer. Another change is that the eye icon now doesn't hide the layer but only the channel you have selected. Finally you can see that the masks don't show up anymore.

The Hue, Saturation, Value and the Fac are what is then visible in the interface: You can create your own node groups this way and then load them into Layer Painter as explained below. Input settings There are a few settings for the inputs of your node group that should come in handy. They give you the ability to change the appearance of your node group in the interface. You can find them when editing the node group. They are in the Node tab under the Layer Painter panel. The 'Use Blending' settings is only important if you are creating a custom mask so we will disregard it now. Below you can see the 'No Color Ramp ... selected' info.

Base Color: This is the base color of the created image. The image will be filled with that color. Resolution: This is the resolution of the created image. 32 bit Float: This will create the image with 32 bit float enabled. You might want to use this for something like a normal map.

It will enable the channel that you import automatically. To use it just click the 'Open PBR' button in the layer settings. It will open a filebrowser where you can select the images you want to import. Finally click the 'Open PBR Texture Set' button. Identifiers To figure out what images to import into what channel the addon uses identifiers. These are basically a short string of characters which describes the name of the channel. To put it simple for a channel like 'Albedo' this could be 'albedo', 'alb', 'col', 'diff' or something similar. These identifiers are specified in the addons preferences and you can change them. In the preferences navigate to PBR Import and you will see the list of identifiers. There is one entry per channel. You can add new entries for channels. You can also add particular identifiers by adding it to the particular field. Identifiers are separated by ';' and you do not need spaces around it. Assets There is also the option to use a thumbnail preview for your texture libraries. Simply click the Assets button and a popup will open. Here you will see the different categories that you have. When you select a category you get a selection of your texture sets. Below it will show the textures belonging to that set and you can choose which ones to import. Add texture assets To add a texture asset path you need to go to the addons preferences again. Here you can add paths which will be used in the list. A folder with images is considered a texture set. If multiple sets are in a folder that is considered the category for those texture sets. You can also have icons by naming them the same way the texture sets folder is named.
